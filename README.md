# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Diabetes is a highly concerning condition that necessitates regular monitoring of insulin levels and careful management of dietary intake. Neglecting diabetes can have fatal consequences, as it can lead to significant damage to vital organs such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Moreover, it affects various other organs, including the eyes, where it can cause cataracts and, in severe cases, blindness.The peripheral nervous system, skin, and feet are also commonly affected, with complications such as gangrene requiring surgical intervention. Calculating diabetes risk in patients typically involves two main steps: data pre -processing, where relevant attributes are identified, and the construction of predictive models using decision tree methods. Several tools are available for this purpose, utilizing metrics like mean absolute error, and relative squared error. Healthcare sectors possess vast databases, often containing structured, semistructured, or unstructured data. Big data analytics is the process through which these datasets are analysed to uncover hidden information and patterns, thereby extracting valuable knowledge. In countries like India, diabetes has emerged as a significant health concern, classified as a non-communicable disease. With millions affected worldwide, machine learning algorithms offer promising approaches to predicting diabetes risk based on various patients attributes. Diabetes is typically categorized into Type 1 (InsulinDependent Diabetes Mellitus) and Type 2 (Non-InsulinDependent Diabetes Mellitus), making it a subject worthy of in-depth study and analysis.
